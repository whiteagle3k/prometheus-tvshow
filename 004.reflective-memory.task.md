# Task: Add Reflective Memory and Local Logs for Characters

## Objective

Enable characters to remember recent interactions and reflect on them. Each entity should maintain a short-term memory log and use it to generate more coherent and context-aware behavior over time.

## Goals

- Give each character a memory buffer (e.g., list of recent messages/events)
- Allow the character to reference or reflect on recent events during autonomous speech
- Store memory locally (per entity) for replay or inspection
- Design message format so other subsystems (e.g. Graphonaut, future summarizers) can access

## Requirements

- [ ] Implement per-character memory log (configurable length, e.g., last 20 messages)
- [ ] On each autonomous message generation, optionally include a memory-relevant phrase
  - e.g., “Earlier, Max mentioned he felt distant…”
- [ ] Store logs in `entities/<name>/memory/log.jsonl` or equivalent
- [ ] Update via internal API or directly from message bus
- [ ] Memory should not persist across restarts (yet) — keep it in-memory or transient

## Optional (Bonus):

- [ ] Add a `/tvshow/logs/<character>` endpoint to retrieve logs via API
- [ ] Format log entries as structured JSON (timestamp, speaker, type, content)

## Output

- Characters can refer to recent past
- Developers can inspect per-character logs
- Groundwork laid for emotional states, summaries, and later long-term memory modules

## Priority

High — this deepens character believability and prepares for future evolution.
