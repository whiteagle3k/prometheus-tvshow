# Task: Create Basic UI for TV Show Chat Interface

## Objective

Implement a minimal frontend interface (director console prototype) that enables observation of character dialogues and allows basic interaction via scenario injection or scripted events.

## Goals

- Build a web-based UI (React, Vite, or Streamlit acceptable) under `/tvshow/ui` or served from `/tvshow/ui/`
- Display shared chat feed from active characters
- Allow input of scenario triggers or script snippets
- Display current scenario status and active character list
- Include refresh or WebSocket-based updating
- Keep architecture clean and separated from Prometheus core UI (if any)

## Requirements

### Frontend Capabilities:

- [ ] Show scrolling feed of character messages (timestamp, name, content)
- [ ] Simple text box to inject a script or trigger into ScenarioManager
- [ ] Show currently active scenario(s) (name, description)
- [ ] Show list of active characters with short descriptors

### Integration

- Backend API:
  - `GET /tvshow/chat` — retrieve latest chat messages
  - `POST /tvshow/scenarios/trigger` — inject or activate a scenario
  - `GET /tvshow/status` — show current scenario + characters

- Frontend:
  - Use lightweight design (minimal styling)
  - Allow iterative improvements as future versions add richer control

## Output

- A working frontend interface accessible locally
- Connects to backend API endpoints
- Enables basic live observation of the TV Show simulation
- Enables manual trigger injection for testing and narrative iteration

## Priority

High — this interface is the primary tool for early testing, tuning, and development feedback.
