# Task 008: Implement LoreEngine and Connect Ontological Lore to Simulation

## Objective

Create a dedicated `LoreEngine` module that loads, parses, and exposes the canonical lore file (`lore.md`) to all components of the TV Show simulation.  
This engine becomes the ontological source of truth for world logic, character motivations, narrative arcs, and glossary terms.

## Goals

- [ ] Create `lore_engine.py` inside `extensions/tvshow/`
- [ ] Load and parse `lore.md` into structured format (dicts/lists)
- [ ] Provide high-level access methods:
  - `get_core_dream(character_id)`
  - `get_traits(character_id)`
  - `get_world_name()`
  - `get_law_of_emergence()`
  - `get_glossary_term(term: str)`
  - `get_arc(title: str)`
  - `list_all_arcs()`
  - `get_theme_statements()`
- [ ] Expose singleton `lore = LoreEngine()` to be imported by:
  - Reflector (scene context enhancement)
  - Entity (dream vector, voice echo)
  - ScenarioManager (arc selection / dynamic narration)
  - Mood system (emotional weather descriptors)
- [ ] Add validation and error handling for malformed entries

## Optional

- [ ] Allow override of `lore.md` via settings/env var
- [ ] Hot reload support during dev mode

## Output

- A fully functional `LoreEngine` that provides canonical context to all TV Show components
- Clean API surface for semantic queries
- No need to hardcode narrative rules, traits, or glossary in logic

## Priority

High â€” this establishes the lore as a dynamic part of the system, not just static flavor text.
