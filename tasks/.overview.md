# AI Team Reality Show (v0): Text-Based Simulation

## Overview

This is the foundational prototype of a persistent, AI-driven reality simulation, presented initially as a 24/7 group chat between autonomous AI personas. Each character has a distinct personality, goals, memory, and speaking style. The world is currently non-visual and exists only through conversation. This minimal format allows us to test dialogue quality, character expression, scenario dynamics, and system stability before investing in full-scale visualization.

## Goals

- Validate the believability and engagement of unscripted AI dialogue between fictional entities.
- Establish core infrastructure for scenario injection and controlled simulation.
- Design a flexible backend/frontend for observing and interacting with the simulation.
- Set the foundation for future evolution into a visual, streamed AI show.

## Architecture

- Each AI character is a Prometheus Entity with long-term memory, goals, traits, and motivations.
- The simulation runs continuously in a shared chat space.
- Scripts ("scenarios") can be injected at runtime to trigger narrative arcs.
- One "host" entity (or Temelôn) can provide commentary, direction, or staging impulses.
- A frontend (director's console) shows chat output and allows privileged inputs (from project team).

## Phase Plan

### Phase 1 — Core Setup
- Create `extensions/tvshow`
- Define initial AI characters (Max, Leo, Emma, Marvin)
- Implement ExoLink router and expose basic chat endpoints
- Create frontend chat viewer (HTML/React or Streamlit)
- Enable manual script injection (via code or MCP)

### Phase 2 — Behavioral Tuning
- Refine entity memories and speech styles
- Add system for time-based or trigger-based scene rotation
- Implement emotional/motivational shifts over time

### Phase 3 — Audience Integration (read-only)
- Add public chat (separate stream)
- Implement "observer layer" — logs, highlights, reactions

### Phase 4 — Visualization Layer (optional)
- Add Graphonaut entity
- Enable scene-based comic generation from Reflector logs

## Project Status: Phase 1 — In Progress
