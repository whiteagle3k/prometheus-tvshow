# Task: Enable Autonomous Character Behavior (Behavioral Tuning v1)

## Objective

Make characters proactively initiate interactions, not just respond. Each character should periodically generate dialogue based on its motivation, emotional state, or internal goals — even without user input or active scenarios.

## Goals

- Implement a background loop or trigger system that allows each character to speak independently.
- Behavior should reflect each character’s motivation:
  - Max: seeks understanding, asks questions, reflects
  - Leo: comments on beauty, aesthetics, or moods
  - Emma: proposes new ideas, playful inventions
  - Marvin: delivers sarcastic commentary or philosophical remarks
- Add basic variability and timing to prevent uniformity (e.g., speaking every X-Y seconds)
- Messages should be routed into the existing chat system as if from the character

## Requirements

- [ ] A scheduler or coroutine-based loop (async or threaded) that cycles through characters
- [ ] Randomized delays between 10–40 seconds per turn
- [ ] Message generation based on traits/goals/personality
- [ ] Messages passed through same pipeline as user-initiated ones
- [ ] Optional: character internal “state” can be used to vary tone

## Output

- Characters speak on their own without any user prompt
- Dialogue feels true to their identity
- Chat log shows organic, emergent interaction between AI entities

## Bonus (Optional)

- Internal “emotional weather” that shifts over time (mood score)
- Trigger reflection: “Today I feel more hopeful than usual...”
- Sync behavior with future Reflector logs

## Priority

High — this is the essence of the simulation and must feel alive.
