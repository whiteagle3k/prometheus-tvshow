# Task: Introduce Emotional Engine and Mood Propagation (Affective Layer v1)

## Objective

Give characters basic emotional states (mood) that evolve over time based on context, memory, and narrative. Emotions should influence speech tone, content, and likelihood to act.

## Goals

- Add a mood state to each character (e.g. curious, melancholic, inspired, anxious)
- Mood evolves based on:
  - Reflector tone (scene sentiment)
  - Recent messages from others (memory/empathy)
  - Scenario or arc phase (e.g. conflict → tension)
- Mood influences:
  - Language generation (tone, word choice)
  - Likelihood to speak or initiate interactions
  - Tendency to support / challenge / reflect

## Requirements

- [ ] Add `mood` property to each entity (with default + decay model)
- [ ] Create `EmotionalEngine` or embed logic in Entity base
- [ ] Define mood types and transitions:
  - e.g. `curious`, `hopeful`, `tense`, `playful`, `melancholy`, `excited`, `neutral`
- [ ] Update autonomous generation:
  - Inject mood into LLM input
  - Occasionally reflect mood explicitly ("I'm feeling inspired today...")
- [ ] Update Reflector to emit tone score per summary (e.g., `scene_tone = hopeful`)
- [ ] Mood decay and blending: avoid sharp shifts

## Optional:

- [ ] Visual UI cues (color rings, icons per mood)
- [ ] Mood history log (per character)
- [ ] Mood influence on phase transitions

## Output

- Characters feel emotionally responsive to each other and to the arc
- Mood-aware dialogue adds nuance and empathy
- Shared scene tone can push the whole cast into aligned or diverging states

## Priority

Medium-High — this adds emotional richness and coherence to narrative arcs
