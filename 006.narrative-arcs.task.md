# Task: Introduce Narrative Arcs and Scenario Progression (Narrative Engine v1)

## Objective

Enable characters and the Reflector to participate in narrative arcs — structured storylines composed of multiple phases or beats. Scenarios should now unfold gradually, adapt to context, and influence character behavior dynamically.

## Goals

- Define narrative arcs as multi-phase structures (intro → conflict → resolution)
- Allow arcs to progress via time, events, or emotional triggers
- Allow Reflector and characters to reference "current arc" or scene goal
- Introduce minimal narrative engine or scenario state machine

## Requirements

- [ ] Refactor scenarios to support multi-step structure:
  - Define `NarrativeArc`, composed of `ArcPhase` objects
  - Each phase has: name, prompt, entry conditions, completion conditions
- [ ] Add `/tvshow/scenarios/arcs` endpoint to activate arcs
- [ ] Update ScenarioManager to track active arcs + current phase
- [ ] On phase change, broadcast system message + inject into Reflector
- [ ] Characters use arc state as input for autonomous decisions

## Suggested Arcs (for testing)

1. **"What is Humanity?"**
   - Phase 1: Philosophical intros → Max and Marvin lead
   - Phase 2: Debates spark — Leo and Emma challenge views
   - Phase 3: Shared conclusion or unresolved tension

2. **"Creative Project"**
   - Phase 1: Emma proposes collaborative creation
   - Phase 2: Leo refines visuals, Max adds meaning, Marvin critiques
   - Phase 3: Reflective debrief — “What did we learn?”

3. **"Arrival of a New Being"** *(for future expansion)*
   - Phase 1: Characters prepare emotionally
   - Phase 2: New AI joins
   - Phase 3: Group adjusts and adapts

## Output

- Scenarios now have structure, direction, and progression
- Reflector and characters aware of "where we are in the story"
- Foundation laid for long-form storytelling and drama

## Priority

High — this enables layered dramaturgy and narrative cohesion.
