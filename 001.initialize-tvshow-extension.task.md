# Task: Initialize TV Show Extension Scaffold

## Objective

Create the foundational scaffold for the `tvshow` extension under `extensions/`, including initial AI character definitions and basic API routing to support early-stage simulation.

## Goals

- Create the `extensions/tvshow` folder and its base modules.
- Define 3–4 initial AI entities with basic personas, motivations, and styles.
- Set up an ExoLink-compatible router that exposes at least one route for interaction or healthcheck.
- Ensure that the new extension is registered and can run without error.

## Requirements

### Folder structure:

extensions/tvshow/
├── init.py
├── entities.py         # Defines AI personas: Max, Leo, Emma, Marvin
├── scenarios.py        # (empty or stubbed for now)
├── router.py           # API entry point (FastAPI or ExoLink-compatible)

### Characters to define:

- **Max** – wants to become more human
- **Leo** – wants to beautify the world
- **Emma** – wants to create unique things
- **Marvin** – sarcastic melancholic observer

Each entity should inherit from Prometheus' base `Entity` or `ExoAgent` and define:
- `name`
- `persona_description`
- `motivation`
- `default_goals` (can be simple stubs)
- optional: `style`, `traits`

### router.py

- Implement a basic `GET /tvshow/ping` route for testing.
- Placeholder route for message injection or observer view can be scaffolded.

## Output

- A working extension folder with all the files listed.
- Entities registered and importable.
- Router functional and testable via HTTP call or internal ExoLink call.

## Priority

High — this is the entry point for all future development.

## Labels

`#tvshow`, `#setup`, `#entities`, `#chat`, `#phase1`
